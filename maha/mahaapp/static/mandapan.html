     Rajarajan Mani Mandapam was constructed to honor the illustrious Chola King Rajaraja Chola during the 8th World Tamil Conference in 1995. This exquisite edifice is designed in the architectural style characteristic of the Chola era. The ground floor accommodates a museum, established in 1984 to celebrate the 1000th birth anniversary of Rajaraja Chola, renowned as the most distinguished king of Thanjavur.
